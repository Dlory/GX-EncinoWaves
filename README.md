## Graphics Experiment - FFT Ocean Water Simulation

NOTE: needs at least Unity3D 5.3.4f1 to work due to a bugfix in that version.

## Features

* Compute shader based FFT with configurable size (default is 256)
* Tessellated close ocean mesh locked to camera
* Ocean extended to horizon using dynamic frustum/plane intersection
